# Bot wire protocol

Line-based protocol over raw TCP. The canonical reference is
[upstream PROTOCOL.md](https://github.com/freehuntx/gpn-tron/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md);
this page documents how `algo-tron` implements it and the small divergences.

## Framing

- Packets are pipe-separated UTF-8 fields terminated by `\n`.
- Format: `<type>|<arg1>|<arg2>|...\n`.
- The server reads lines with `bufio.Scanner` and a **1024-byte buffer**. A line that exceeds 1024 bytes (including the newline) causes the scanner to fail and the connection to close — there is **no** `ERROR_PACKET_OVERFLOW` packet; the bot just sees an EOF.

## Connection lifecycle

    |                                            |
    | (idle until the next game)                 |
```

The final tick of a game **omits** the trailing `tick\n` — the `win`/`lose` packet ends the game frame.

Several boards run in parallel and players are matched by TrueSkill rating (see [matchmaking.md](matchmaking.md)); a board holds at most 24 players. None of this changes the wire protocol — `lose` arrives when you die, and the idle gap until your next `game` packet is simply short (typically seconds, bounded at ~20s) because dead bots re-enter the matchmaking queue immediately instead of waiting for their old game to finish. Ids (`pos`, `die`, `message`, your own id in `game`) are always scoped to your current game.

## Server → bot packets

| Packet           | Args                          | When                                                            |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `motd`           | `text`                        | Once, immediately after connect.                                |
| `error`          | `CODE`                        | See [error-codes.md](error-codes.md).                           |
| `game`           | `width\|height\|your_id`      | Once per game, sent to each bot individually with its own ID.   |
| `player`         | `id\|name`                    | Once per alive player at game start.                            |
| `pos`            | `id\|x\|y`                    | Once per alive player at game start and per tick.               |
| `tick`           | —                             | End of each tick frame (except the game's final tick).          |
| `die`            | `id[\|id...]`                 | At the start of any tick where players died.                    |
| `message`        | `id\|text`                    | When a player's chat passes validation and rate-limiting.       |
| `win` / `lose`   | `wins\|losses`                | Game end. Counts are over a rolling 2-hour window.              |

## Bot → server packets

| Packet | Args               | Notes                                                                                       |
|--------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `join` | `username\|password` | First packet. Username must match `^[a-zA-Z0-9 _\-\.!?,:#]+$`, ≤32 chars; password ≤128. |
| `move` | `up\|right\|down\|left` | One per tick is enough — the server keeps the most recent direction. Up to `movePacketsPerTick` are accepted per tick at the TCP layer; over-budget moves are dropped silently and add a strike. Dead players' `move` packets are accepted but ignored. |
| `chat` | `text`             | Same character class as username, ≤64 chars. Up to `chatPacketsPerTick` accepted per tick at the TCP layer; over-budget chats add a strike. Of the accepted chats, only **one per tick interval** actually posts — extras get `WARNING_CHAT_RATE_LIMIT`. |

## Rate limits

Three per-connection budgets, enforced inside `handlePacket` as **token buckets**: each bucket refills at its budget per tick interval and holds up to `rateLimitBurstTicks` (2) ticks' worth of tokens. The burst capacity matters — a client that stalls for a tick (GC pause, slow inference, network jitter) and answers two ticks back-to-back must not lose a move. Over-budget packets are dropped; a contiguous run of them costs one strike against the connection.

The tick interval used for refill accounting is the bot's **own board's** current interval (1s while unseated/queued).

| Budget                  | Limit                       | What it covers                                                                |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `totalPacketsPerTick`   | 10 per tick interval        | Every packet, regardless of type. Caps unknown/malformed packets too.         |
| `movePacketsPerTick`    | 5 per tick interval         | Just `move` packets (seated players).                                         |
| `chatPacketsPerTick`    | 3 per tick interval         | Just `chat` packets at the TCP layer; chat-message posting is still 1/tick.   |

A packet must clear the global budget *and* its per-type budget. If either fails, the packet is dropped.

### Strikes → warn → disconnect → reconnect penalty

A **contiguous run** of dropped packets costs **one strike**, no matter how long — a single over-budget burst can't burn through all strikes before the client sees the warning. The run ends with the next allowed packet.

| Strike count                 | Effect                                                                                          |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| below `rateLimitErrorStrikes` | Server sends `WARNING_RATE_LIMIT`. Connection stays open.                                      |
| `rateLimitErrorStrikes` (3)  | Server sends `ERROR_RATE_LIMIT`, then closes the connection.                                    |

Strikes are forgiven after `rateLimitStrikeExpiry` (1 minute) without a new one — strikes only matter when denial runs keep happening.

When a connection is closed for hitting the strike cap, the account's **reconnect penalty** doubles (capped at `reconnectPenaltyMax = 60s`, starting from `reconnectPenaltyBase = 1s`). The next `join` for that account within the penalty window is rejected with `ERROR_RECONNECT_PENALTY|<seconds_remaining>` and the connection is closed. The penalty survives across reconnects — it only stops growing when the bot stops getting kicked.

Sequence example:

```
spam → 3 strikes → ERROR_RATE_LIMIT, kick, penalty = 1s
reconnect after 1s → spam → kick, penalty = 2s
reconnect after 2s → spam → kick, penalty = 4s
…
spam after 6 kicks → kick, penalty = 60s (capped)
```

The penalty is per-account (keyed by username), in-memory only — it does not survive a server restart.

## What's allowed / what's not

| Allowed                                                                                          | Not allowed                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sending one `move` per tick (or a few — server keeps the latest).                                | Sending more than `movePacketsPerTick` (5) `move`s in a single tick interval.                     |
| Sending a `chat` once per tick interval while alive.                                             | Sending more than `chatPacketsPerTick` (3) `chat` packets per tick at TCP — silent drop + strike. |
| Sending an unknown packet type once in a while (you'll get `ERROR_UNKNOWN_PACKET` but stay on).  | Spamming unknown/malformed packets — counts against the global limit, same strike track.          |
| Reconnecting after a clean disconnect.                                                           | Reconnecting inside the penalty window — rejected with `ERROR_RECONNECT_PENALTY`.                 |
| Same username + password from a new TCP connection — old one is kicked with `ERROR_ALREADY_CONNECTED`. | Holding > `maxConnections` (5) simultaneous TCP connections from the same IP (localhost exempt). |

## Reserved usernames

Usernames matching `^bot\d*$` (`bot`, `bot1`, `bot42`, …) and the filler-bot names `alice` / `bob` (case-insensitive) are rejected with `ERROR_NO_PERMISSION` when the connection comes from a non-localhost IP. The `bot*` slots let local benchmark/test clients pick those names without anyone else hijacking them; `alice` and `bob` are owned by the two built-in filler bots so real players can't impersonate them.

## Account reuse

`username` + `password` is an account. First join creates it; subsequent joins must match the HMAC-SHA256 hash stored on disk or receive `ERROR_WRONG_PASSWORD`. If the same account is already connected, the old connection receives `ERROR_ALREADY_CONNECTED` and is closed before the new one takes over.

> **Never reuse a real password.** The protocol is plain TCP — the password travels unencrypted, and the server stores only a fast keyed hash. Treat it as a claim ticket for the username, nothing more.

**Idle accounts are recycled.** A username whose account hasn't connected for 30 days can be claimed by joining with any new password. The previous owner's stats (ELO, TrueSkill, score history) are reset for the new owner; the old career is archived server-side (see [persistence.md](persistence.md)), not deleted.

**Reconnecting mid-game:** if you reconnect while your seat is still alive (only possible within one tick of the disconnect — otherwise the seat is killed), the server re-sends the `game` header plus the current `player`/`pos` snapshot so your bot can reorient. Trails are not replayed — the protocol has no message for them.

## PROXY protocol

If started with `-proxy-protocol`, the server expects a single HAProxy PROXY protocol **v1** header line before `join`:

```
PROXY TCP4 <client_ip> <proxy_ip> <client_port> <proxy_port>\n
```

`PROXY UNKNOWN` is accepted (the remote-address IP is kept). A malformed header gets `ERROR_PROXY_PROTOCOL` (not in upstream).

| `ERROR_INVALID_USERNAME` (non-string)     | Not emitted; the protocol is text, so non-string usernames are not representable.          |
| `ERROR_INVALID_PASSWORD` (non-string)     | Same as above.                                                                              |
| —                                         | `ERROR_PROXY_PROTOCOL`, `WARNING_CHAT_RATE_LIMIT`, `WARNING_RATE_LIMIT`, `ERROR_RATE_LIMIT`, `ERROR_RECONNECT_PENALTY` added. |
